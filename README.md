# Foundations of computational psychiatry - Fall 2022

**Instructors**: [Vincenzo Fiore](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/vincenzo-guido-fiore), [Angela Radulescu](https://www.angelaradulescu.com/) 

**Teaching Assistant**: [Kaustubh Kulkarni](https://kulkarnik.github.io/)

**Time**: Mondays 1-4pm

**Location**: Sinai Center for Computational Psychiatry, 55 W 125th St, Floor 13

**Format:** This course will follow a hybrid lecture and lab structure. Lectures will be held in person and will be followed by a live lab portion. We encourage in person attendance, though we will make available recordings of each lecture.

**Overview:** At the intersection of psychology, neuroscience and AI, computational models are aimed at understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying cognitive processes, decision-making and behavior, and how these processes are altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. In this course, students will gain exposure to the goals, foundational ideas, and technical concepts behind computational cognitive modeling. They will be introduced to several modeling approaches, including Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning and neural modeling. And they will get hands on experience with building and fitting models to data from different modalities.  

**Readings:** Reading for the course (~4 hours / week) will consist of selections from several textbooks, as well as recent literature in computational psychiatry that applies these concepts to the understanding mental dysfunction.
